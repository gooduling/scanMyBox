# Scan My Box App

How to Use:

1. Fill the form for each box you pack.
2. Get the unique ID for each box which is usually 4 latin letters E.g. "LPOF".
3. Write this ID legibly by hand right on the box.
4. Check the box by sending the ID to telegram-bot [t.me/scanMyBox_bot](https://t.me/scanMyBox_bot).
5. You can use built-in image scanning of your phone for reading the codes.   
6. All data is stored in a public Google-sheet. You can integrate this functionality with your own google-infrastructure.
7. Please be aware, that any person who see the code can scan it and see the information you filled in. Avoid posting sensitive information in box description.
You still can add encoded link to such type of information instead.
